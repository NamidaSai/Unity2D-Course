Soldiers rush past your window, their swords banging on their armors and their shouts searing your eardrums. 
Behind you, the Chen family whispers, worried, clinging to their worn out clothes, the parents hushing their kids.
Gao Fa stays in the opposite corner, quiet, finishing his pebble soup hurriedly. Buddhist monks don't waste.
Wang Ao gently brushes Na's long hair as they hang on to each other tightly.

These people count on you to get them out of the city, before the Songs' and Mongols' fight razes everything you hold dear.
If the naval bombardments don't get you first, their swords, axes and huochong firearms would do the trick. You've got to get out of here.
Easier said than done. The naval battlefield will reach the docks soon enough. 
Could try escaping by foot, but if the city guards spot you, you'll be drafted to the frontline.

Fortunately, you've got a plan. You ALWAYS have a plan.

1. Find a way to your junk to sail out of the city.
2. Use the smuggling tunnels to get out beyond the walls.
