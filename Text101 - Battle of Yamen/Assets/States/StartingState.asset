  storyText: "Soldiers rush past your window, their swords banging on their armors
    and their shouts searing your eardrums. Behind you, the Chens cling to their
    worn out clothes, the parents hushing their kids. Gao Fa stays in the opposite
    corner, quiet, finishing his pebble soup hurriedly. Buddhist monks don't waste.
    \n\nIf the naval bombardments don't get you first, the Mongols' swords, axes
    and huochong firearms will do the trick. You've got to get out of here, but if
    the Songs' guards spot you, you'll get drafted to the frontline.\n\nFortunately,
    you've got a plan. You ALWAYS have a plan.\n\n1. Find a way to your junk to sail
    out of the city.\n2. Use the smuggling tunnels to get out beyond the walls."
